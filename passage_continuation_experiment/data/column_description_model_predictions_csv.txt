*** Description for each column in model_prediction.csv ***



- Counts for the bare-prompt condition:
countNP1: number of continuations where NP1 is the first mention in the bare-prompt condition
countNP2: number of continuations where NP2 is the first mention in the bare-prompt condition
countTotalNP12Remention: sum of countNP1 and countNP2
countNP1_smoothed: countNP1 + 2
countNP2_smoothed: countNP2 + 2
countTotalNP12Remention_smoothed: countTotalNP12Remention + 4
countOvertProNP1: number of continuations where NP1 is the first mention and is referred to using an overt pronoun in the bare-prompt condition
countOvertProNP2:  number of continuations where NP2 is the first mention and is referred to using an overt pronoun in the bare-prompt condition
countOvertProNP1_smoothed: countOvertProNP1 + 1
countOvertProNP2_smoothed: countOvertProNP2 + 1

- Counts for the pronoun-prompt condition:
countPromptPro: total number of continuations for the item in the pronoun-prompt condition
countNP12GivenPro: sum of countNP1GivenPro and countNP2GivenPro
countNP1GivenPro: number of continuations where NP1 is the first mention in the pronoun-prompt condition
