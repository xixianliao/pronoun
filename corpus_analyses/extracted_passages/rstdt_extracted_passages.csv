The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin: North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral. 

In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members.
The magazine alleged that in making the donations, the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards, or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren. 

The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report.
And at first, neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue.
But the press kept it alive; as with the Recruit scandal, lists began circulating with names of people who had received money. 

Within a matter of weeks, less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations.
So far, though, there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members received amounted to bribes.
Then the two camps upped the ante: Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members. 

The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization, and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ($880,000) and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen.
On Friday, the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry, including 450,000 yen ($3,175) by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
No one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal. 

Direct donations from either of the residents' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign, but both groups deny making direct donations.
They say its possible some of their members may be donating privately. 

The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents, those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese.
That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society. 

Many Japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians, the way many Japanese do, to win favor or support. 

Both residents' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad.
But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP's alleged donations, implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally.",non pronoun,other,other,not_subject,not_non_subject

But Laura Cunningham's Bronx, her childhood Bronx of the '50s, is something else altogether.
In a lovely, novelistic memoir, ""Sleeping Arrangements"" (Knopf, 195 pages, $18.95), she remembers an exotic playground, peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic (real oddballs like her sexpot friend, the hell-kitten Diana, age five). 

Ms. Cunningham, a novelist and playwright, has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall.
She transforms her ""Bronx of the emotions, a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria"" into the ""Babylonian Bronx,"" a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue.
In the Babylonian Bronx, Jewish working-class people lived in drab, Soviet-style buildings ""glamorized"" with names like AnaMor Towers (after owners Anna and Morris Snezak), whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of Pompeii. 

For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl: "". . . outwardly ordinary, inwardly ornate, owing all inspiration to heathen cultures."" Sharp-witted and funny but never mean, she's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote, if he'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy. 

Little Lily, as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book, really wasn't ordinary.
She was raised, for the first eight years, by her mother, Rosie, whom she remembers as a loving liar, who realigned history to explain why Lily's father didn't live with them.
Rosie reinvented this man, who may or may not have known about his child, as a war hero for Lily's benefit. 

Rosie died young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure, who didn't interfere much with her child's education on the streets.
The games Bronx children played (holding kids down and stripping them, for example) seem tame by today's crack standards, but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure. ""Without official knowledge of sex or death, we flirted with both,"" she writes.
She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements.
Her friend Susan, whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted, slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents' bedroom, as though she were a temporary visitor.
Her friend Diana's father was a professional thief; they didn't seem to have any bedrooms at all. 

Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting.
When Rosie died, her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements.
They painted the apartment orange, pink and white, according to her instructions.
With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe, an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist (who rhymed river with liver in a love song); and Uncle Len, a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope, like an ""undercover President on a good-will mission."" 

They came by their strangeness honestly.
Lily's grandmother, no cookie baker, excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album, and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress, ""Philosophy for Women."" 

The book loses some momentum toward the end, when Lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family.
